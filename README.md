The dataset contains the following columns:

- `meta_score`: The Metacritic score of the game.
- `title`: The title of the game.
- `platform`: The platform on which the game is released.
- `date`: The release date of the game.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JonasDias10/machine-learning.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd machine-learning
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
